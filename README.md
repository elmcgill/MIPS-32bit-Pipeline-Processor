# MIPS-32bit-Pipeline-Processor
Computer Engineering 381 MIPS 32bit Pipeline Processor Project

Project has the CPRE381 testing framework included. The source code for the processor is written in vhdl and is located in ModelSimWork/src.

Unfortunately we did not complete all functionality. Everything was working at demo except for branching and jump register and jump and link.
